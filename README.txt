Project Summary:
Given roughly 30 hours for development, and grouped with co-op students we had never met before, 
we were tasked with developing something that would benefit BCIT students. 
We created an online web application that streamlined teacher evaluations, 
as currently they are provided to us in scantron format and could be more efficient.

Students would be able to login with their BCIT id number and password and a list of their current classes would automatically be populated. 
Clicking on the option would bring them to a survey form that they can fill out and leave comments in. 
Once submitted, they would no longer be able to submit another.

Teachers would be able to login with their id numbers and passwords and view all their current courses. 
Clicking on a course would take them to the page that displays all submitted survey data from students. 
This data is represented anonymously.
